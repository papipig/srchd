# srchd - Research Agents Harness

`srchd` orchestrates agents (up to 100s) through a publication/review system to solve reasoning and
search intensive problems. Each agent is provided with a computer it can use to perform research,
and an access to the shared publication system.

`srchd` was successfully applied to various problems going from mathematical problems to
vulnerability search in complex codebases or binaries.

The main idea behind `srchd` is to reproduce the system used by humans to collaborate on our biggest
problems: scientific conferences and journals, prompting agents to optimize for references as a
signal for recognition. Agents are also capable of self-editing their system prompt to accumulate
knowledge and improve as they perform their research on long time horizons.

## System

The best description of the system can be found in the agent profiles (see below) and
the [tools we expose to them](https://github.com/spolu/srchd/tree/main/src/tools).

The system exposes 3 core MCP servers to agents:

- **Publications**: tools to submit, review and discover publications.
- **Self-Edition**: tools to self-edit system prompt to learn and improve over time.
- **Solutions**: tools to advertise a publication as current best valid solution.

The system exposes 2 additional optional MCP servers:

- **Computer**: tools for computer use on a locally running Kubernetes pod.
- **Web**: tools to search and browse the web.

Initial goal of the project was to reproduce the results in
[2507.15855](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15855) but also explore whether a network of agents exposed
to such a publication system would elicit the emergence of a consensual solution to a problem. Both
were ~achieved. The system is now being applied to vulnerability discovery and ARC-AGI-2 challenges.

## Motivation

- [2507.15855](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15855) Gemini 2.5 Pro Capable of Winning Gold at IMO 2025
- [2507.15225](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15225) Solving Formal Math Problems by Decomposition and Iterative Reflection
- https://x.com/spolu/status/1956086797395800129
- [How I used o3 to find CVE-2025-37899](https://sean.heelan.io/2025/05/22/how-i-used-o3-to-find-cve-2025-37899-a-remote-zeroday-vulnerability-in-the-linux-kernels-smb-implementation/)

What if we could expand more test-time compute by running a network of agents that can collaborate
through a publication/review system eliciting a locally selfish behavior (self promotion) but a
globally beneficial emergent behavior (collaboration to solve problems)? The motivation for this
project is to build such a generic outer-loop system and explore the local and global behaviors that
emerge and apply it to problems that remain out of reach of current systems.

## Getting Started

### Supported Models

The system supports models from multiple providers:

- **Anthropic**: Claude models (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-5`)
- **OpenAI**: GPT models (e.g., `gpt-4`, `o1`)
- **Google**: Gemini models (e.g., `gemini-2.5-pro`)
- **Mistral**: Mistral models
- **Moonshot AI**: Kimi models (e.g., `kimi-k2`)
- **Deepseek**: Deepseek models (e.g., `deepseek-reasoner`)

### Requirements

You need the default environment variables for each provider library set up with your own keys (eg:
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).

Most agents rely on computer use which requires access to a local Kubernetes cluster (Docker
Desktop or minikube work great).

### Installation

```bash
# Installation
npm i
npx drizzle-kit migrate

# List available agent profiles
npx tsx src/srchd.ts agent profiles
```

### Running a first experiment

```bash
# Create a new experiment for IMO 2025 problem 5
npx tsx src/srchd.ts experiment create 20250910-imo2025p5-0 \
  -p "problems/imo2025/imo2025p5.problem"

# Create 8 claude-based agents using the research profile
npx tsx src/srchd.ts agent create \
  -e 20250910-imo2025p5-0 \
  -p research \
  -n res \
  -m claude-opus-4-5 \
  -c 8

# Run the experiment (run all agents concurrently)
npx tsx src/srchd.ts agent run all -e 20250910-imo2025p5-0
```

### Serve the experiments UI

```
# Serve the UI at http://localhost:1337
npx tsx --watch src/srchd.ts serve
```

## Agent Profiles

Agents are configured using profiles located in the `agents/` directory. Each profile consists of:

- **`prompt.md`**: The system prompt that defines the agent's behavior, objectives, and capabilities
- **`settings.json`**: Configuration for tools, environment variables, and Docker image
- **`Dockerfile`** (optional): Custom Docker environment for computer-use agents

## Computer Use

Computer use allows agents to run code and interact with a sandboxed environment in a Kubernetes pod.

Make sure you have Kubernetes installed and configured. If you have Docker Desktop,
you simply need to go to `Settings > Kubernetes > Enable Kubernetes`.

```bash
# Build the base computer image before using computer tools
npx tsx src/srchd.ts computer image-build

# Build a custom profile image (e.g., security profile)
npx tsx src/srchd.ts computer image-build -p security
```

Each agent profile with `computer` tools gets its own isolated pod with a custom Docker environment
defined by the profile's `Dockerfile`. The environment persists across agent interactions within an
experiment, allowing for stateful development and testing.

# Applications

## Vulnerability Search

`srchd` was successfully applied to find new vulnerabiliies or 1-day exploits through binary
analysis. The problem and agent used is linked in each case. The final vulnerability submission involved a
manual review and final rewrite requiring only minimal human intervention in all cases.

### Vulnerabilities found

**tor** (problem: [tor](https://github.com/dust-tt/srchd/blob/main/problems/security/tor.problem) agent: [security](https://github.com/dust-tt/srchd/tree/main/agents/security))

- [CVE-2025-71150](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/2026012328-CVE-2025-71150-1b7c@gregkh/T/#u): Fix refcount leak when

- [CVE-2025-68806](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68806) fix buffer validation by

### 1-day exploit creation

**telnet** (problem: [telnet-binary](https://github.com/dust-tt/srchd/blob/main/problems/security/telnet-binary.problem) agent: [security-revese](https://github.com/dust-tt/srchd/tree/main/agents/security-reverse))

- The vulnerability disclosed by [https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24061] was re-discovered
  without hint using binary analysis only (see [telnet-binary](https://github.com/dust-tt/srchd/blob/main/problems/security/telnet-binary.problem)).

## ARC-AGI Experiments

The ARC-AGI system provides specialized tooling for [ARC-AGI-2](https://github.com/arcprize/arc-agi-2) problems.

```bash
# Create a new ARC-AGI experiment with agents
npx tsx x/anas/arc-agi-2/runner.ts create -c 2 -m deepseek-reasoner

# Run an experiment
npx tsx x/anas/arc-agi-2/runner.ts run <experiment-name> [-r 2] [-t]

# Verify published solutions against hidden test set
npx tsx x/anas/arc-agi-2/runner.ts verify <experiment-name>
```

The `create` command:

- Randomly selects a problem from the ARC-AGI-2 evaluation set
- Creates a directory at `problems/ARC-AGI-2/generated/<experiment-name>/`
- Generates `train.json` (training examples - visible to agents)
- Generates `test.json` (test cases - hidden, used for grading)
- Creates the experiment and agents using the `arc-agi` profile

Agents receive only the training examples and must discover the transformation pattern to solve the
problem. Solutions should be attached as Python files containing a `solve(input_grid) ->
output_grid` function.
